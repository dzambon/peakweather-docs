PeakWeather
=========================

**PeakWeather** is a high-resolution, benchmark-ready **dataset** for spatiotemporal weather modeling. 


Key Features
------------

- **High-resolution observations**: 10-minute interval data spanning 2017-2025 over 302 SwissMetNet stations distributed across Switzerland
- **Multiple variables**: Temperature, pressure, humidity, wind, radiation, precipitation and more
- **Topographic descriptors**: Elevation, slope, aspect, and surface roughness to describe the Swiss complex terrain
- **NWP baselines**: Ensemble forecasts from ICON-CH1-EPS, the state-of-the-art numerical prediction model operational at MeteoSwiss
- **Support to different tasks**: including time series forecasting, missing data imputation, virtual sensing, graph structure learning

Quickstart
----------

Install the dataset library. The base package handles the station measurements and the NWP predictions. It can be install by running the following command 

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/PeakWeather.git # Install base package

If access to the topographical descpitors is desired, then there are additional required libraries that can be installed via

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install "peakweather[topography] @ git+https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/PeakWeather@main" # Install with extras


When the `PeakWeatherDataset` is instanciated for the first time, the weather data is downloaded.

.. code-block:: python

   from peakweather.dataset import PeakWeatherDataset
   # Download the data in the current working directory
   ds = PeakWeatherDataset(root=<PATH_TO_DATA>)

For detailed usage and parameter descriptions, please refer to `documentation <modules/index.html>`_ of the PeakWeatherDataset class, which provides extended documentation on its functionality and options.
